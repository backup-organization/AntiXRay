A plugin that allows you to stop X-Ray hacks on your server.

## What is this?
AntiXRay is a plugin that interacts directly with the protocol. It is capable of preventing the potential sending of chunks that are unreachable within the player's range. AntiXRay is the first known, most effective plugin for PocketMine to effectively stop X-Ray hackers.

## Features
- It makes what is outside the player view range invisible. 
- Customizable. AntiXRay can work in configurable heights, as well as toggleï¿¼ specific features like only hiding ores or hiding full chunks.
- It can effectively stop any attempt to load blocks or chunks that are out of range.
- Good code quality.

**AntiNukeX is a prototype** and there is still room for refinements.
